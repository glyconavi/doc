## About GlycoNAVI TCarp

* [GlycoNAVI TCarp](https://glyconavi.org/TCarp/) is a database that provides information on glycan structures, and can access to data of  glycans and proteins using Semantic Web technology, that is a secondary database of PDB to provide extracted and annotated glycan structures and their surrounding environment. Users can access to the data not only from a browser but also through our SPARQL endpoint and APIs.


## How to use

### Search

*  Text Search

    * TCarp Text Search is a text search for proteins using strings such as Title, Descriptor, PDB ID, Uniprot ID, and common name.

    1. Typing your search query into the text box and pushing the search button.
    
    2. The results of the text search will be displayed in a table.

    3. You can refine your search by using the search box on the upper right.

    4. Browse the table and click on the TCarp ID link to go to the details page of TCarp.

  * Common Name Search is a search that utilizes trivial names, synonyms, abbreviations and other carbohydrate names based on CAN resource of GlycoNAVI.
  
  1. Click the Common Name Search image.
  
  2. Typing your search query into the text box.
  
  3. Clicking on CommonName or WURCS will display a list of entries containing that glycan structure. (If no entry is found, "No data available in table" is displayed.)

  4. Browse the table and click on the TCarp ID link to go to the details page of TCarp.
